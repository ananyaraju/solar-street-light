# Automated Motion-Detecting Solar-Tracking Street Light System

## Description

The automated motion-detecting solar-tracking street light systems aims to maximise the light energy falling on the solar panel attached to a street light as well as minimise the electrical energy utilized by the street light at any given point in time. With the help of this project, the direction of the solar panel adjusts to where maximum sunlight is incident on it. Moreover, it aims to minimise power utilization by automatically dimming the street light when there is no vehicle or object 
movement detected.
This is a smart system that switches on and off depending on the day time. The system will be capable of adjusting itself to amplify solar energy generation on its own. To increase efficiency, the system shall dim the street light whenever there no motion detection near the street light. 

## Design

The street light system is designed on an Arduino microprocessor, using 2 Light-Dependent Resistors, an SG90 Servo Motor, a Solar Panel, a Passive Infra-Red Detector, a rechargeable Ni-Mh bettery and an LED bulb.
